  cpu:
    description: |
      K8s cpu resource limit, e.g. "1" or "500m". Default is unset (no limit). This value is used
      for the "limits" portion of the resource requirements (the "requests" portion is
      automatically deduced from it).

      K8s memory resource limit, e.g. "1Gi". Default is unset (no limit). This value is used
      for the "limits" portion of the resource requirements (the "requests" portion is
      automatically deduced from it).

  ingestion-rate-mb:
    description: |
      Per-user ingestion rate limit (MB/s).
      This config option matches exactly Loki's `ingestion_rate_mb`, except that it is an integer here
      (Loki takes a float).
      This same value is used internally for setting `per_stream_rate_limit`. Loki uses a default of 3 for
      `ingestion_rate_mb`, but 4 for `per_stream_rate_limit`. For this reason we use 4 as the default here.

  ingestion-burst-size-mb:
    description: |
      This config option matches exactly Loki's `ingestion_burst_size_mb`, except that it is an integer here
      (Loki takes a float).
      This same value is used internally for setting `per_stream_rate_limit_burst`. Loki uses a default of 6 for 
      `ingestion_burst_size_mb`, but 15 for `per_stream_rate_limit_burst`. For this reason we use 15 as the default
      here.

    default: 15
  retention-period:
    description: |
      Sets a global retention period, in days, for log streams in Loki.
      The minimum retention period is 1 day, and a value of 0 (default) means "infinity" (disables retention).
      Loki will not be cleaning up logs if duration is set to 0.
      This config maps directly to the loki `compactor.retention_enabled` configuration option, which is set to `false` when no retention period is defined.
      Specifying retention periods for individual streams is not currently supported.
